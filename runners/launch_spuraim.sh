#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Self-hosted launcher for the SPUR cluster (Crusoe-operated, 126x MI355X in
# partition amd-spur). The Actions runner lives on the login node
# (crs-m2m-cpu-spur-009), which has NO GPUs and NO docker -- it only
# orchestrates. The recipe runs on a worker, reached via srun.
#
# Why this cannot reuse launch_mi355x-amds.sh:
#
#   SPUR is not Slurm. It is Crusoe's Rust reimplementation of the slurm CLI
#   (`spur` 0.6.0); srun/sinfo/squeue are compat wrappers talking to spurctld.
#   Three differences break the amds path outright:
#
#     1. `salloc` DOES NOT EXIST. Only srun/sbatch/squeue/sinfo/scancel/scontrol
#        are provided. The amds salloc -> enroot import -> pyxis srun flow has
#        no entry point here.
#     2. There is NO `--export` flag of any kind, so nothing from this shell's
#        environment reaches the job. Every value is instead interpolated
#        literally into the inner script generated below, which srun then runs
#        by path off NFS. Nothing depends on env inheritance.
#     3. SPUR does have native container flags (--container-image/-mounts/-env),
#        but exposes no knob for /dev/kfd, /dev/dri, --group-add, --shm-size or
#        ipc=host -- all mandatory for ROCm. So we srun a plain bash script and
#        use docker inside it, matching slurm_container_runtime=docker.
#
# Weights: /shared_nfs (150 T) is mounted on both login and worker nodes and
# already holds a complete HF hub cache, including the 1.5 TB moonshotai/Kimi-K3
# checkpoint and both DSpark drafters. It is READ-ONLY to us, so we mount it
# read-only, run HF offline against it, and hand the recipe a MODEL_PATH that
# points straight at the snapshot -- kimik3_fp4_mi355x.sh then takes its
# "already present" branch and never calls `hf download` against read-only
# storage. Node-local /mnt/m2m_nobackup (28 T NVMe) supplies the writable
# scratch that HF, aiperf and vLLM still need.
#
# Env parity: on the amds slurm path `srun --export=ALL` hands the container the
# entire benchmark-tmpl.yml env block. Here there is no such mechanism, so every
# variable in that block is written to a docker --env-file below. Keep the two
# in sync when benchmark-tmpl.yml gains a variable.

# Started non-exclusive to avoid queueing (only ~8 of 233 nodes are ever fully

# Run 30870535817 died with VllmWorker-4 killed by a signal during
# determine_available_memory() -- the VRAM profiling run -- with no OOM kill
# recorded on the node (memory.events oom_kill 0) and no HSA fault in the log.
# A co-tenant holding VRAM at that instant produces exactly that, because
# --gpu-memory-utilization 0.88 is computed against TOTAL VRAM, and the node
# did have another user's processes on it.
#
# It is NOT proven that co-tenancy caused it -- kimik3-...-dspark's own comment
# documents this same c1 cell both passing and dying on byte-identical command
# lines upstream. That is the point: while co-tenancy is in play, a failure
# cannot be attributed, so the known-flaky cell can never be judged. Exclusive
# removes the one variable we control. Set SPUR_EXCLUSIVE=0 to trade it back
# for schedulability on workloads that do not need whole-node VRAM.
# Back to NON-exclusive, and this time on evidence rather than on convenience.
#
# Exclusive was made the default to remove co-tenancy as a confound after run
# 30870535817 lost a worker. That confound has since been disproven twice: the
# non-DSpark control (30872688837) came up and served on a shared node, and the

# rate and ~16s duration as the upstream mia1 arm (30873376524) on a dedicated
# fleet. Co-tenancy is not what breaks these runs.
#
# Meanwhile exclusive is now a real cost: with the partition at 84 alloc / 60
# mix / 68 resv and 67+ jobs queued, demanding a whole node means waiting, and
# TP8 already needs all 8 GPUs so exclusivity buys almost nothing extra. Set

# 36096 sat PENDING with Reason=None and TIME 0:00 for 35+ minutes while the
# partition had 13 idle nodes -- and a byte-identical srun submitted by hand at
# the same moment, same account/qos/gres/cpus/time/exclusive/arg-order/name and
# the same Priority=1000, dispatched instantly. Submitting context was ruled out
# too (an interactive shell and a `systemd-run --user` scope both schedule fine).
# The srun client stays alive and connected; the job simply never runs.
#
# There is no knob for this, so treat a non-starting job as a failed submission:
# give it SPUR_START_TIMEOUT to reach RUNNING, then scancel and resubmit. Once
# it is running we just wait, however long the benchmark takes.
# DEFAULT IS OFF (0 = wait indefinitely), and that default is the important part.
#
# This watchdog was written on the belief that SPUR "strands" jobs, because they
# sat PENDING with Reason=None while `sinfo -p amd-spur` showed idle nodes. That
# reading was wrong on both halves:
#   * Reason=None is just SPUR not populating a reason string. It does not mean
#     the scheduler has forgotten the job.
#   * Partition-wide idle count is NOT our entitlement. amd-spur's ~228 nodes are
#     shared by 19 accounts (AllowAccounts on the partition), and per-team access
#     is a fair-share/QoS cap -- the cluster docs quote figures like "Primus (16
#     nodes)", "AIFW-DEV (19 nodes)". Idle nodes elsewhere in the partition are
#     other teams' entitlement, not ours.
