# Configs

The config files in this directory are meant to be a "source of truth" for what benchmark configurations can/should be run. As such, they must follow a precise format which is described below.

## Master Configs (AMD, NVIDIA, etc.)

```yaml
entry-name:
  image: string
  model: string
  model-prefix: string
  runner: string
  precision: string
  framework: string
  # Optional defaults for every search-space entry in this config.
  router: { name: string, version: string }
  kv-transfer: { name: string, version: string }
  scenarios:
    fixed-seq-len:
    - isl: int
      osl: int
      search-space:
      - { tp: int, conc-start: int, conc-end: int }
      # Optionally, specify 'ep' (expert-parallelism) and 'dp-attn' (data parallel attention)
      - { tp: int, ep: int, dp-attn: bool, conc-start: int, conc-end: int }
      # Optionally, declare router and KV transfer component metadata.
      - tp: int
        router: { name: string, version: string }
        kv-transfer: { name: string, version: string }
        conc-start: int
        conc-end: int
      - ...
    - ...
    agentic-coding:  # optional
    - trace-source: string
      search-space:
      - { tp: int, conc-start: int, conc-end: int }
      - ...
```
Note: while not required, `entry-name` typically takes the format `<INFMAX_MODEL_PREFIX>-<PRECISION>-<GPU>-<FRAMEWORK>`.

The below list describes what each field is:

- `image`: The image used to serve the benchmark, e.g., `vllm/vllm-openai:v0.10.2`
- `model`: The model to server, e.g., `openai/gpt-oss-120b`
- `model-prefix`: The canonical InferenceMAX model prefix reference, i.e., `dsr1` for Deepseek, `gptoss` for gptoss-120b, etc. This value is used to decipher which script in `benchmarks/` should be used in order to launch the benchmark.
- `runner`: This is the runner label on which to run the benchmark. This must be a valid key under `labels` in `runners.yaml`.
  Agentic configs must use an exact `cluster:<name>` runner label, not a broad
  SKU or capacity label, so every search-space point runs on the same hardware
  fleet.
- `precision`: The precision to run the benchmark. Again, this is used to find which script to run in `benchmarks/`.
- `framework`: The framework (serving runtime) to serve the benchmark, e.g., `vllm`, `sglang`, `trt`.
- `scenarios`: A dictionary of benchmark scenario types. At least one must be specified. Currently supported:
  - `fixed-seq-len`: Fixed input/output sequence length benchmarks. Each entry must have:
    - `isl`: An integer representing the input sequence length, e.g., `1024`
    - `osl`: An integer representing the output sequence length, e.g., `8192`
    - `search-space`: A list of configurations to run with respective `isl` and `osl`, each entry must be a dict with the following fields:
      - `tp`: An integer representing the tensor parallelism level that the configuration will be served at.
      - `conc-start`: An integer representing the starting level of concurrency e.g., `4`
      - `conc-end`: An integer representing the ending level of concurrency (inclusive) e.g., `128`
      - Note: the step factor between `conc-start` and `conc-end` is 2, so if `conc-start` is 4 and `conc-end` is 128, all concurrencies `4, 8, 16, 32, ..., 128` will be run.
      - (Optional) `ep`: An integer representing the expert parallelism level that the configuration will be served at. Default is 1 (no expert parallelism) when not specified.
      - (Optional) `dp-attn`: A boolean representing whether or not to activate data parallel attention for the configuration. Default is false when not specified.
      - (Optional) `router`: Router metadata containing exactly non-empty `name` and `version` strings.
      - (Optional) `kv-transfer`: KV transfer metadata containing exactly non-empty `name` and `version` strings.
  - `agentic-coding`: Agentic trace replay benchmarks using real conversation traces. Each entry must have:
    - `trace-source`: Identifier for the trace dataset to use.
    - `search-space`: Same structure as `fixed-seq-len` search-space entries.

`router` and `kv-transfer` may be omitted independently. When either field is
present, both `name` and `version` are required and additional keys are rejected.
Top-level declarations apply to every scenario and search-space entry in that
master config. A search-space declaration overrides the corresponding top-level
value for that point.

Agentic duration is not a master YAML field. Matrix generation defaults agentic
jobs to 3600 seconds; reusable workflow callers may override the `duration`
input.

Notes:
- No extra fields besides the ones listed may be specified, or else the benchmarks will fail to run.
- Setting the fields above, particularly `ep` and `dp-attn`, only guarantee that the respective values will be passed as environment variables to the benchmark scripts! Actually using those environment variables is an implementation detail at the level of the benchmark Bash script.

## Runners

The `runners.yaml` config represents available runner labels and reusable
hardware facts in the repository. It has two top-level sections:

```yaml
labels:
  cluster:b300-nv:
    - b300-nv_01
    - b300-nv_02

hardware:
  cluster:b300-nv:
    available-cpu-dram-mib: 2964436
    gpus-per-node: 8
```

`labels` maps a schedulable runner label to the concrete runner node names that
can satisfy that label. `hardware` maps hardware or fleet keys to host resource
facts. Matrix generation reads the `hardware` entry whose key matches the
master config's `runner` label when a benchmark needs derived hardware facts.
Use `cluster:<name>` labels for hardware metadata that depends on an exact
cluster/fleet rather than a broad SKU label. Agentic master configs must use a
`cluster:<name>` runner label.
`available-cpu-dram-mib` is the host CPU DRAM available to benchmark jobs, in
MiB. Agentic DRAM KV-offload matrices combine it with `gpus-per-node` and the
master config's `dram-utilization` to emit `total-cpu-dram-gb` for benchmark
templates.
