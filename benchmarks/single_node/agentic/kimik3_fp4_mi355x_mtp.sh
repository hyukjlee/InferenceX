# kernel failure cannot be attributed to a KV-offload connector.

# bf16 KV, against the fp8-everywhere rule for this model, and deliberately so
# for now: mla_gluon's fp8 regime (bh16bn128) asserts batch_size == 1, but the
# DSpark verify step calls it with batch_size = the number of verify tokens (8
# at num_speculative_tokens 7). Stock therefore cannot run DSpark under
# --kv-cache-dtype fp8 at all. The patched b128 kernel this recipe pulls from
# the gist is what lifts that restriction, so fp8 DSpark becomes possible once
# that combination has actually been validated -- until then, auto.
# bf16. fp8 + DSpark is blocked on ROCm at the DRAFTER: it asserts
# supports_quant_query_input, triton_mla sets that False, and ROCM_AITER_MLA
# (which sets it True) is causal-only while DSpark is non-causal. The blog's
# fp8 works because FLASHINFER_MLA is CUDA-only and has both. Documented
# exception to the fp8-everywhere rule; revisit if triton_mla learns to
# dequantize the query. KV usage at our crashes was 31-83%, so the pool is not
# the binding constraint at these concurrencies anyway.

# Keep the DSpark arm off the unmerged vLLM#50578 asm-pad patch. It is inert
# here by construction (use_gluon_decode gates on max_qo_len == 1, and verify
# runs at 8, so decode never reaches the asm path), and leaving it out keeps
# this arm a clean single-variable test of the forward_mqa fix.
# Gluon verify. Padded asm verify does not verify (574/574 accepted,
# per-position all 1.000), and the native MTP path imposes causal masking that
# DSpark cannot take (acceptance 1.41-4.76 vs 6.41-8.00). Both refuted today.

#
# Evidence it is: at k=7 every arm died at 90-130 completions; at k=2 (which
# caps per-step context growth at 3 tokens) fork run 30874551315 survived ~50
# minutes and then faulted with num_computed_tokens=37686. k changed how fast
# depth accumulated, not whether the fault happened -- which is what a
# depth-dependent buffer or indexing bug looks like.
#
# 32768 sits below the ~37.7k where it faulted. Two outcomes, both useful:
#   pass -> depth is the trigger; also gives an immediately usable (capped) K3
#           DSpark lane while the kernel bug is chased.
#   fail -> depth is not the trigger and the hypothesis dies cheaply.

# k=2, down from the reproducer's 7. Two reasons, both about the crash rather

#   1. The flatten branch's verify batch is max_num_seqs * ~(k+1), so k=7 put
#      the mla_gluon call at ~9x mns (144 and 225 against the kernel's 128 cap
#      at mns 16 and 32). k=2 takes that to ~3x, well clear of the cap.
#   2. The HSA abort tracks context depth, not request count: every k=7 arm
#      died at 90-130 completions, and the only cell that ever finished was the
#      one whose acceptance collapsed to ~1.5 and so accumulated context ~4x
#      slower per step. k=2 caps per-step growth at 3 tokens by construction.
# Costs peak acceptance (6.41-8.00 of 8 at k=7), which is the trade being made.
